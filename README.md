Game Engine Senior Project

A physics engine created for my Mechatronics and Robotics class. The goal is to create an application that can simulate and edit physics based applications.

This engine can be used to create an interactive apllication or game with real or modified physics.

This engine uses C++ and OpenGL while utilizing a dynamic linking library.
